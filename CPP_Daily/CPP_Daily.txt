--------------------------
Que. linker links main.o and .lib/.dll or .so filer into a.exe but what are these .lib / .dll /.so files?
`.lib`, `.dll`, and `.so` files are types of libraries used in C++ development:

- **.lib** (Static Library or Import Library, Windows):  
  Contains compiled code that can be linked directly into your executable at build time. If you use a static `.lib`, its code becomes part of your `.exe`.

- **.dll** (Dynamic Link Library, Windows):  
  Contains compiled code that is loaded at runtime. Your program uses an import `.lib` to know how to call functions in the `.dll`, but the actual code stays in the `.dll` and is loaded when your program runs.

- **.so** (Shared Object, Linux/Unix):  
  Similar to `.dll`, but used on Linux/Unix systems. It contains code that is loaded dynamically at runtime.

***
These files provide reusable code (functions, classes, etc.) that you can use in your programs without having to write everything yourself.
example -#include <iostream> // Reusable code for input/output

# Datatypes

***Member function do not get space inside object.  But variables do


Que. Why pointers are used in C but not in C++ struct with member functions
First code (C) uses pointers because functions are separate from the struct; passing pointers is needed to modify the original struct data.

Second code (C++ style) embeds functions inside the struct; functions can directly modify the struct's own data members using this pointer implicitly, so no explicit pointer parameter is needed.

What to use in C -
Declare structs to hold data only.
Use separate functions taking struct pointers to operate on the data.

What to use in C++ -
Use structs or classes with member functions inside.
Call functions on struct objects directly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember Syntax
emp.Employee::printRecord( ); //message passing 


-----------------------------
Never forgot to write 

using namespace "namespace_name"
or access variable in namespace using :: (Scope Resolution Operator)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
//typedef is used to create the alias for existing data type (class / structure)
//reference is used to create alias of existing object


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Que. Why malloc return type is void* ?
// void* malloc(size_t size); 

malloc(size_t size) means: “Give me a block of memory of size bytes.”

But malloc doesn’t know what you want to store there (int? float? struct?).

That’s why it returns a generic pointer → void*.

👉 A void* pointer in C means:

"This is a pointer to some memory, but I don't know the data type yet."
So after malloc, you decide the type by typecasting it.

Syntax -

int *p = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));   // memory for 5 integers
float *q = (float*) malloc(10 * sizeof(float)); // memory for 10 floats

🔹 free(ptr);

When you call malloc, memory is given from the heap.

That memory will not be automatically released when the function ends.

If you keep allocating and never release → memory leak (program wastes memory).

👉 free(ptr); tells the system:

"I’m done using this memory, you can take it back."

So after free(ptr);

The memory block in the heap (that stored 100) is returned to the OS.

But the pointer ptr still holds the old address (like 1000 in your diagram).

This makes it a dangling pointer → dangerous if you accidentally use it.

🔹 ptr = NULL;

After free, ptr is still pointing to freed memory.

Accessing it (*ptr) would be undefined behavior.

Setting ptr = NULL; makes it safe.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Allocation in C

 int *ptr = new int; 

🔹 What happens here

new int → asks the system for memory in the heap for one integer.

It returns the address of that memory (just like malloc).

ptr (an int*) will store that address.

So now ptr points to a heap location that can store 1 integer.

## Some other Syntaxes -

//int *ptr = new int; // Default value garbage; 
    
//int *ptr = new int( ); // default value 0 

//int *ptr = new int(3);  // value at ptr = 3


## Array of Integers

//int *ptr = new int[3]; //12 bytes //here default will be garbage

int *ptr = new int[3](); //12 bytes //here default value 0


## Syntax for 2D array

----Array of Pointers-----
// int **ptr = (int**)calloc(4 , sizeof(int*));

// int **ptr = new int *[4];

DAY 5

Association -(has-a) relationship

1. Composition - Tight Coupling 
	
2. Aggregation - Loose Coupling

class Date {

	//TODO
};

class Employee{

	Date joindate; //Here we create object inside object (object will compulsorily get space inside Employee class) Therefore Tight Coupling 

	Date *joindate; //Here we created pointer , object is not stored inside object of Employee , this will be somewhere in heap memory(Loose Coupling)

};


---------------------



#Inheritance

- is a relationship

- Also called as GENERALISATION
- Inheritance is a journey form GENERALIZATION TO SPECIALIZATION

- In C++, default mode of inheritance is private

- All the non static data members of base class get space inside object of derived class. In other words, non static data members of base class, inherit into derived class.

- Using derived class, we can access static members of base class. In other words, static data members of base class, inherit into derived class

- All the data members( static/non static) of base class of any access specifier(private/protected/public), inherit into derived class but only non static data member get space inside object

- Size of object of Base class = size of of all the non static data members declared in base class.

- Size of object of Derived class = size of of all the non static data members declared in base class + size of of all the non static data members declared in derived class.

- Static and Non static member functions are inherited into derived class



Following function do not inherit into derived class:

1.Constructor

2.Destructor

3.Copy constructor

4.Assignment operator function

5.Friend function



* If we create object of derived class then first base class constructor gets called and then derived class constructor gets called. Destructor calling sequence is exactly opposite.
* From any constructor of derived class, by default, base class's parameterless constructor gets called
* If we want to call, any constructor of base class from constructor of derived class then we should use constructor's base initializer list.
(Day5_4.cpp)




# TYPES OF INHERITANCE - 



1. Implementation Inheritance 
2. Interface Inheritance



Both has 
1. Single Inheritance

2. Multiple Inheritance

3. Hierarchical Inheritance

4. Multilevel Inheritance




# Shadowing (Day5_9.cpp)

If name of base class and derived class member function is same and if we try to call such member function on object of derived class then preference is given to the derived class member function. **Here derived class member function hides implementation of inherited function**. This process is called shadowing.

Without changing implementation of existing class, if we want to extend meaning of that class then we should use inheritance


#DIAMOND PROBLEM

1.During diamond inheritance, data members of indirect base class inherit into indirect derived class multiple times. Hence it affects on size of object of indirect derived class.
2.During diamond inheritance, member function of indirect base class inherit into indirect derived class multiple times. If we try to call member function of indirect base class on object of indirect derived class, compiler generates ambiguity error.
3.During diamond inheritance, if we create object of indirect derived class the constructor and destructor of indirect base class gets called multiple times.


If we want to avoid diamond problem then we should declare base class virtual. ****

two pointers in B and C are added when be declare Indirect Base class as virtual , One in B and One in C
It decreases the size of Indirect Derived Class 
(When we create more )

}

# Object Slicing -
If we assign , derieved class object to the base class object then compiler considers
only base class members from derieved class object and copy it into base class object.

During object slicing mode of inheritance should be public

int main7()
{   //If we assign , derieved class object to the base class object then compiler considers
    //only base class members from derieved class object and copy it into base class object.

    b1 = d1; 
    b1.printRecord( ); 
    return 0;

#UPCASTING- 

Process of converting pointer of derived class into pointer of base class is Upcasting

int main8()
{
    Derived *ptrDerived = new Derived(10,20,30); 
    //ptrDerived->printRecord( ); //10 20 30  
    //Base *ptrBase = (Base*)ptrDerived; // upcasting

    //ptrBase->printRecord( ); //10 20  
    ptrDerived = (Derived*)ptrBase; // downcasting 
    ptrDerived->printRecord( ); //10 20 30   
    return 0;
}

 
--UPCASTING IN SINGLE LINE and DOWNCASTING
int main9()
{
    Base *ptrBase = new Derived(10,20,30);//upcasting  in single line
    //ptrBase->printRecord( ); //10 20   
    Derived *ptrDerived = (Derived*)ptrBase; //downcasting 
    ptrDerived->printRecord( ); 
    return 0;
} 

# DOWNCASTING -
Process of converting pointer of base class into pointer of derived class is Downcasting


--WITHOUT UPCASTING YOU CANNOT PERFORM DOWNCASTING , IF YOU WANT TO DOWNCAST WE COMPULSARILY FIRST UPCAST
int main10()
{
    Base *ptrBase = new Base(10,20); 
    ptrBase->printRecord( ); 
    Derived *ptrDerived = (Derived*)ptrBase;
    ptrDerived->printRecord( );  
    return 0;
}


Que What is the need of creating object dynamically , if we can create it on compile time ?
=>

-------------
# Use of UPCASTIING - (PRACTICAL APPLICATION)

Book *book
Tape *tape
.
.
.
.

If there are 1000 products we need to create 1000 pointers //NOT OK        (Day6_5.cpp)

We can use UPCASTING and create only one pointer of Product class          (Day6_6.cpp)
and copy the address of Derived class object into Base Class Pointer //OK

int main()
{
    int choice; 
    while((choice = ::menulist())!=0)
    {
        Product *ptr = NULL;  //USED ONLY ONE POINTER 
        switch (choice)
        {
        case 1: 
            ptr = new Book( ); // upcasting 
            ptr->acceptRecord( ); 
            ptr->printRecord( ); 
            break;
        case 2: 
            ptr = new Tape( );  //upcasting 
            ptr->acceptRecord( ); 
            ptr->printRecord( ); 
        }
        delete ptr; 
        ptr = NULL; 
    }
    return 0;
}

(Day6_7.cpp) ---> we made code compact , BUT 

There is problem , it is calling Products class accept and print 
pagecount , playtime is getting ignored from book and tape class

Product * ptr ------------> this is where problem is occurring , COMPILER IS SEEING THE TYPE OF POINTER which is Product , so it will call Products class accept and print 

//Rather than looking at the type of object compiler checks the type of pointer  . THIS IS CALLED "EARLY BINDING"


So, we use "virtual" keyword in accept and print member functions of Products class ("VIRTUAL KEYWORD")
It will now behave according to object and will take accept , print of object

now pagecount and playtime will be considered;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# FUNCTION OVERRIDING -

- Process of redefining "virtual" function of the base class inside derived class with the same signature is called "FUNCTION OVERRIDING"

# RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM / DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH

- By using base class pointer we call derived class member functions . This process is called Run Time Polymorphism.

# FOR FUNCTION OVERRIDING - (ONLY VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS ARE OVERRIDDEN)***

1. Function must be inside base and derived class too
2. Signature of base class function and derived class function must be same
3. Atlest function in Base class must be "virtual" 
-------------------

# VIRTUAL FUNCTION -
- function with virtual keyword 
- In case of upcasting, a function, which gets called depending on type of object rather than type of pointer is called virtual function.
- If we are performing Overriding means same signature function in both base and derived class and if we declare member function of base class as virtual then derived class member function 	is taken into consideration
# POLYMORPHIC CLASS -
	class with atleast one virtual function is Polymorphic class

*** Constructor cannot be virtual
*** Static Member function cannot be virtual 
Hence cannot be Overridden
-----------------------------------------
# ABSTRACT METHOD -

virtual void acceptRecord(void) = 0;

Function with "virtual" keyword and no body initialized with 0 (PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION)

Que. If we dont use virtual like [ void acceptRecord(void) =0; ] and initialized with 0,  Is it correct ?
=> If we declare like [ void acceptRecord(void) = 0 ] it cannot be overridden until its declared virtual 
   and function like [ void acceptRecord(void) = 0 ] is of no use

# ABSTRACT CLASS -

- If our class contain atleast one Abstract method/ Pure Virtual function then it is Abstract class
- Overriding virtual function is not mandatory , but overriding pure virtual function is mandatory
- If not then Derived class also be Abstract

# Interface -

- If class has all pure virtual functions then it is call pure abstract class / Interface .

# Interface Inheritance 

- Inheritance between Interfaces is called as Interface Inheritance

# Design Pattern - 

1. Factory Method
2. Singelton Method

2.Non overridden function of derived class 

=> then we should use down casting.


# typeid -
typeid is a function defined in typeinfo header file 
It returns the reference object of typeinfo class  

eg - typeid(baseptr)

//cout<<typeid(shape).name()<<endl;    P5Shape (Pointer -> P , character_count -> 5 , actual_character(typename) -> shape )
//cout<<typeid(*shape).name()<<endl;   9Rectangle ( character_count -> 5 , actual_character(typename) -> shape )

-----------Day 8--------------

# C++ Vectors
- A vector in C++ is like a resizable array.
- Both vectors and arrays are data structures used to store multiple elements of the same data type.
- The difference between an array and a vector, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (you cannot add or remove elements from an array). A vector however, can grow or shrink in size as needed.

- Create a vector called cars that will store strings: 
eg - vector<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// Print vector elements
for (string car : cars) {
  cout << car << "\n";
}


-->> Operation on vector
1. push_back
2. pop_back
3. push_front
4. pop_front
5. begin
6. end
7. erase

> Day 3 Revision

1. this pointer

- If we call member function on object then compiler implicitly pass, address of current object as a argument to the function.
- To store address of argument(current object), compiler implicitly declare one pointer as function parameter inside member function. It is called this pointer.
- General type of this pointer is : ClassName *const this;
- this is a keyword in C++.
- Using this pointer, non static data member and non static member function can communicate with each other hence, it is considered as a link/connection between them
- If name of the data member and name of local variable is same then preference is always given to the local variable. In this case to refer data member, we must use this keyword. Otherwise use of this keyword is optional.

- Following member function do not get this pointer:
	1.Global function
	2.Static member function
	3.Friend function
- We can not declare this pointer explicitly. But compiler consider this pointer as a first parameter inside member function

2. Function Overloading (Compile Time Polymorphism)

	1.If we want to give same name to the function and if type of all the parameters are same then number of parameters passed to the function must be different 
	2.If number of parameters are same then type of atleast one parameter should be different
	3.if number of parameters are same and then order of type of parameters must be different
	
	Defination => Using above rules, Process of defining multiple functions with name is called function overloading. In other words, process of defining function with same name and 	different signature is called function overloading

	-In function overloading return type is not considered. **** IMP
	  Returning value from function and catching value which returned by function is optional hence we can not overload function.


	- Except 2 functions, we can overload any global function as well as member function:
		1.main function
		2.destructor

3. Default Arguments - 
	- Default arguments are always assigned from right to left direction.

4. Initialization - We can initialize any variable only once.

5. Assignment - We can assign value to the variable multiple times.

6. Constructors -
	- We can not call/invoke constructor on object/pointer/reference explicitly. It is designed to call implicitly


	Complex c1;  //	c1 => object
	c1.Complex();  // NOT OK

	Complex *ptr= &c1 ;  //ptr => pointer
	ptr -> Complex() ;  //NOT OK

	Complex &c2 = c1 ; //c2 = reference
	c2.complex;  //NOT OK
	
	- We can not declare constructor static, constant, volatile or virtual. We can declare constructor inline only. (CSV2)

	- We can use any access specifier on constructor.
		1.If constructor is public then we can create object of the class inside member function as well as non member function.
		2.If constructor is private then we can create object of the class inside member function only.

7. Constructor member Initializer List -
	- If we want to initialize data members, according to order of data member declaration then we should use Constructor's member initializer list.
	- Except array and string we can initialize any data member in Constructor member initializer list.
